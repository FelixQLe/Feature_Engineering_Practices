    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA), just like clustering is a partitioning of the dataset based on proximity, we could think of PCA as a partitioning of the variation in the data. PCA is a great tool to help us discover important relationships in the data and can also be used to create more informative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* NOTE: PCA is typically applied to standardized data. With standardized data \"variation\" means \"correlation\". With unstandardized data \"variation\" means \"covariance\". "
