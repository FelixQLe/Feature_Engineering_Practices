    "The k-means algorithm is sensitive to scale. This means we need to be thoughtful about how and whether rescale our features since we might get very different results depending on our choices. As a rule of thumb, if the features are already directly comparable (like a test result at different times), then we would not want rescale. On the other hand, faetures that arenot on comparable scales(like height and weight) will ussually benefit from rescaling. Sometimes, the choice won't be clear though. In that case, we should try to use common sense, remembering that faetures with larger values will be weighted more heavily."
