    "### Introduction\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning Algorithms dont make use of a target, instead, their purpose is to learn some property of the data, to represent the structures of the features in a certain way. In the context of feature engineering for prediction, we could think of an unsupervised algorithm as a \"feature discovery\" technique.\n",

    "simply means the assigning of data points to groups based upon how similar the points are to each other. A clustering algorithm makes \"birds of a feather flock together,\" so to speak.\n",
