# Feature_Engineering_Practices
Feature Engineering(FE) is the most important steps to build a create machine learning model

In this repos, 
- I will practice on FE to determine which features are the most important with mutual information
- Invent new features in several real-world problem domains
- encode high-cardinality categoricals with a target encoding
- create segmentation features with k-means clustering
- decompose a dataset's variation into features with principal component analysis


## -----------------
The Goal of FE is basically make our data great fitted to the ML model to our problem we trying to solve
## -----------------
We want to perform FE to:
* improve a model's predictive power
* reduce computational or data needs
* improve interpretability of the results
